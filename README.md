# Django Tutorial with Clever Programmer

This project was created for following a YouTube tutorial video by Clever programmer for studing purposes. Link for the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw, but just focused in the polls app part, which is the Django documentation getting started tutorial. The other two projects done in the video will be followed in other projects (that I'll list bellow when I had the links) for organization purposes, because my intention is try to improve each project with my own contributions.

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv with a newer Python and Django versions than are used in the tutorial. Therefore, **ensure that you have pipenv installed in your machine** and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following commands line `pipenv shell` and then `pipenv install`.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with the following command line `pipenv shell` and then, considering that you are at the same directory of manage.py file, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
