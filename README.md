# Django Tutorial with Clever Programmer

This project was created for following a YouTube tutorial video by Clever programmer for studing purposes. Link for the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw

## Project dependencies
To get dependencies intallations easy, it was used the pipenv with a newer Python and Django versions than are used in the tutorial. Therefore, **ensure that you have pipenv installed in your machine** and, before everything, install all project dependencies with the following commands line `pipenv shell` and then `pipenv install`.

## Run locally
Everytime you need to run it locally, remember to activate the virtual environment with the following command line `pipenv shell` and then, considering that you are at the same directory of manage.py file, run the command line `python manage.py runserver` or if you prefer, just type `./manage.py runserver`.
